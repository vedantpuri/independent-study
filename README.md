# Independent Study

This is a repository containing my work for my Independent Study under professor Andrew McCallum
in IESL.

## Task

At a high level I am involved in the task of Shallow Semantic Parsing for Scientific Procedural Texts. Within this I am currently responsible for running supervised learning algorithms on the data to predict labels of edges within the texts. As the semester progresses and work completes, I shall be assigned new responsibilities which I shall update it here in a timely manner.

## Requirements
- Python >= **3**
- PyTorch >= **1.0.1**

## Experiments + Results
... *building*
